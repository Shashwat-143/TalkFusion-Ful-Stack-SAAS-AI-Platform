Info:
Customers can build, manage, and communicate with AI powered companions with TalkFusion, a SaaS platform created with Next.js and React. By remembering past talks, these companions use Pinecone for long-term memory, which improves personalization. The platform's Pro plan, which integrates Stripe for subscription management, provides premium capabilities. Clerk manages user authentication, while Prisma connected to a MySQL database securely manages data, including companion profiles. TalkFusion is scalable and utilizes React's component-based architecture with Next.js for server-side rendering. By guaranteeing a responsive design, Tailwind CSS offers a unified user experience across all platforms. Because Vercel is used for platform deployment, serverless execution and smooth scalability to manage heavy traffic are supported.
